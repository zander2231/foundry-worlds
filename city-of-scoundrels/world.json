  "description": "<p>A thousand years ago this was a land of beauty and magic. Then came the cataclysm that blotted out the sun and ripped open the gates to the land of the Dead. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The city of Doskvol is a metropolis of factories and refineries protected by its crackling lightning towers fueled by marvelous electroplasm. Outside the walls is a wasteland of vengeful spirits. Inside is a wretched hive of scum and villainy, intrigue and corruption. Life is cheap in a city ruled by death.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The sun is gone. The only thing that shines in Doskvol are the Blades in the Dark.</p>",
